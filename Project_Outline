1. Brenner-Tershoff Potential Equation Implemented in LAMMPS - locate and move to project directory 
2. Recieve Parameter Set from Dr. Liu (small one first, then full scale) 
3. Use DFT calculations to produce training set 
    training set includes
    a) equations    of    state,    
    b)    lattice    parameters,    
    c)    cohesive    energies,    and    
    d)    elastic    constants    of    different    crystalline    phases    of    Pt
4. Plug parameter sets and training sets into potential equations
