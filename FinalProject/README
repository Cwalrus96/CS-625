TO COMPILE PROJECT: 

1. Compile lammps as a shared library 
    a. navigate to the lammps source directory and use one of the following lines 
     
    make serial mode=shlib  
            or 
    make mpi mode=shlib 
    
    Those lines will take a while to run, and will create a .so file which represents either a serial or mpi version of the lammps library. 
    
2. Add the address of lammps to the library path using the follow code 

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/homes/moonknight/proj/lammps/src
    
    (make sure to adjust the path to point to your lammps .so file) 
    
    
3. Edit the makefile so that the references point to your shared lammps library file, then use the make command to compile
