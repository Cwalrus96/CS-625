(I copied Nasser's instructions on how to compile Simple.c, will edit this file to contain instructions on compiling the project files) 

compile using these 2 lines:

gcc -I/homes/moonknight/proj/lammps/src -c simple.c
gcc -L/homes/moonknight/proj/lammps/src simple.o \
   -llammps -lfftw -lmpi  -lpthread -lstdc++ -o simpleC
   
the path should be where you have the LAMMPS library: liblammps.so
you might need to rename ur compiled library to liblammps.so from what ever it was

before runing the file you need to add the library to library paths for linux cmd. you do that like this:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/homes/moonknight/proj/lammps/src

again this should point to the path where you have ur compiled lammps library liblammps.so

after that you can ran the file using this command:

mpirun -np 1 simpleC 1 in.lj

first number is the number of mpi processes you want to use second number is howmany processes you want LAMMPS to use 
( it can't be more than the mpi processes) and the in.lj is the name of the file you want to run
